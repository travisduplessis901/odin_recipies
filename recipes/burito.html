        <li>1 tablespoon sweet smoked paprika</li>
        <li>½ a tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 bunch of fresh coriander</li>
        <li>1 x 400 g tin of pinto or black beans</li>
        <li>200 g leftover white or brown rice , chilled</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>4 ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 spring onions</li>
        <li>1 little gem lettuce</li>
        <li>4 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>80 g mature Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Greek yoghurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Meanwhile, place the chicken thighs between two sheets of greaseproof paper, then bash with the base of a heavy pan to roughly ½cm thick. 
            Pop into a bowl, sprinkle over the paprika, cumin and a lug of oil, and season well with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix well to coat, then place the chicken onto the hot griddle. Cook for 10 minutes, or until charred and cooked through, turning halfway. Leave to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic. Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks. 
            Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the garlic and coriander stalks and fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Drain, rinse and add the beans, then fry for a further few minutes. Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, or until crisp and piping hot through, stirring occasionally. 
            Finely grate in the lime zest, roughly chop and add half the coriander leaves. Stir well and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the tomatoes and trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add to a bowl with the juice of the lime. 
            Roughly chop and add the remaining coriander leaves, mix well and season to taste. Shred the lettuce and cooled chicken.</li>
        <li>Pop a tortilla onto the griddle for 1 minute to soften, then place onto a board. 
            Spoon one-quarter of the fried rice and beans along the middle, top with a generous spoonful of salsa, a handful of lettuce and one of the shredded chicken thighs. 
            Grate over some cheese and add a spoon of yoghurt.</li>
        <li>Wrap up the burrito, then tuck in. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, serving as you go.</li>
    </ol>
