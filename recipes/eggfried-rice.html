    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 cup basmati rice (200g)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 finely chopped carrot</li>
        <li>3 oz peas</li>
        <li>1 spring onion</li>
        <li>3 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you have pre-cooked rice, skip this step. If not, first rinse the rice so it’s not going to be sticky, then we drain the rice into a large sieve</li>
        <li>Now, in a boiling pot add the rice, a tablespoon of olive oil, a teaspoon of salt ,1 and a half cups of hot water and boil everything for 10 mins at low heat with the lid on</li>
        <li>After the rice has boiled spread it in a oven tray and let it cool for 30 min – 1h</li>
        <li>Then, in a preheated pan at high heat add 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating up, beat the eggs very well and then add them into the pan. Mix and separate the eggs into small pieces. Cook this for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Then add the carrots. Cook for another minute</li>
        <li>Next add the chopped spring onion. Cook for about 10 seconds</li>
        <li>Add the cold rice and the peas. Mix and cook for another minute</li>
        <li>Then add the white pepper and mix some more</li>
        <li>Next, make space in the pan for about a third of it and add the soy sauce. Here’s the secret: let the soy sauce boil for 10 seconds then mix it with the rice. Cook for another minute while mixing, then you can serve</li>
        <li>Add more chopped spring onion over for a bit of freshness</li>
    </ol>
